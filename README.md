# CollectionExtensions

Some miscellaneous utilities and additions to collections.

### Dictionary+Coercion

Adds `stringWithKey`, `intWithKey`, `doubleWithKey` as dictionary subscripts. They do their best to coerce the dictionary value to the correct type.


### Dictionary+Merging

Adds some convenience methods which call on to `merge(other, uniquingKeysWith:` to either replace or keep all duplicate keys.
